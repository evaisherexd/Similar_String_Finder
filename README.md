# Similar_String_Finder

This is a project developed during my second internship.

It is aimed to find out similar string within the same colomn of Excel sheet.

In practice, it is used to find equivalent company name strings as there are some variants eg. "A & B INC." and "A AND B INC." refer to a same company. They should be treated as one company in later analysis. This project accelerates the data cleansing process.

This project should work in other similar contexts.
